# ProtectAntivirus
Antivirus Scanner:

This is an open source Antivirus that helped me to speed up my computer. It scans for malware by viewing its codes and signatures. It contains source code and you are free to make another antivirus with improvments. If you want to edit, make sure that python is installed on your computer. If not installed you can download python from "https://www.python.org/downloads/" and install to your computer. Make sure that the source code is in sources folder and the original exes are outside. If you are Mac or Linux user, you can still run the Antivirus by running the .py . Make sure that you must have python. If you want a bootable version, you should download Antivirus.iso.torrant and download fully using the torrant. You need to have atleast 500 MB USB that you dont mind erasing. Then you need to download Rufus or balenaEtcher [rufus.ie](https://rufus.ie/en/) and https://etcher.balena.io/ respectively. KEEP IN MIND THAT ALL CONTENTS IN YOUR USB WILL BE DELETED! Next clect select file in etcher or select in rufus and open the Antivirus.iso. then insert the usb and start making a bootable Antivirus.
